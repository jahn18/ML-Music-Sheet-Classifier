How to add a jar file

- Since the primus conversor jar file is too big to be pushed on to github, you will need to add it yourself after pulling

- In android studio, go to "Project" View, right click on "app" and create a new folder and name it "libs"

- Then paste the jar file (name is omr-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) into the libs folder that was created

- Then go to File >>> Project Structure, and click on Dependencies, then add the jar file as a jar dependency.

- The path to the jar should be libs/omr-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar or libs\omr-3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar depending on your OS
