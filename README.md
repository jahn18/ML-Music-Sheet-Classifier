# project-team-leptoceratops
CPEN 291 final project for team-leptoceratops

This branch contains the code and the directory configuration that is used in the Google Cloud Linux VM.
The code and the configurations are found in the Server folder.

The setting up as well as most of the code written are from the tutorial
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-flask-application-on-an-ubuntu-vps

The server requires a virtual environment in order to run and since the code is irrelavant they are not included.
